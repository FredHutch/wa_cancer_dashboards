# FH-minimal-mistakes
Fred Hutch version of Minimal Mistakes as a Remote Theme

When using GitHub to drive websites at the Fred Hutch, if you'd like it to look more "Hutch-y" you can fork this repo to get a Fred Hutch tailored theme.  Please file issues in this repository if you have problems and if other people who have used Jekyll and remote themes here at the Hutch can help, they will.  Or perhaps email IT (scicomp or helpdesk at fredhutch.org).  This repository is just up as a copy of what I have done previously.  


OR: Go to the original Theme's github repo: https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes
OR: Go see their docs page: https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/
